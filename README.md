## What is an IP Address?
An IP address is a unique string of numbers separated by periods that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network. It provides identity to a networked device.

## IP Address Assignment
IP addresses can be assigned manually by an administrator or automatically by network protocols.

## IP Address Versions
The presentation covers two versions of IP addresses:
- IPv4
- IPv6

## IP Address Classes
IP addresses are divided into several classes based on their range. These classes include:
- **Class A**: Reserved for large organizations and government bodies. (Range: 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255)
- **Class B**: Used by medium-sized organizations. (Range: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255)
- **Class C**: Intended for small organizations. (Range: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255)
- **Class D**: Reserved for multicast groups. (Range: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255)
- **Class E**: Reserved for experimental use. (Range: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255)

## Public and Private IP Addresses
The presentation explains the differences between public and private IP addresses:
- **Public IP Addresses**: Used for devices that are accessible over the internet.
- **Private IP Addresses**: Used within private networks and are not routable over the internet.

## Static vs. Dynamic IP Addresses
- **Static IP Addresses**: Manually assigned and remain constant.
- **Dynamic IP Addresses**: Automatically assigned by a DHCP server and can change over time.

## Detailed Explanation of IPv4
IPv4 addresses are represented in a 32-bit format and are typically shown in decimal as four octets separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.0.1). The presentation also discusses the binary representation of these addresses.
